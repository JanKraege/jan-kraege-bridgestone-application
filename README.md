<h3>Dear Bridgestone Team,</h3>

      <p>
        My name is Jan and I am currently completing my Master of Business Management at the University of Technology Sydney.
      </p>

      <p>
        What started as an exchange semester in Australia turned into several years of studying, working and growing abroad. Along the way, I gained experience at BRITA Australia, completed my Master's degree and developed a strong interest in commercial strategy, marketing, brand strategy, customer insights and international business.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, after returning to Germany, I am looking for the next challenge to start my professional career. The Bridgestone European Graduate Program in Marketing immediately stood out to me because it combines exactly the areas that excite me most: brand management, customer insights, data-driven marketing and international collaboration.

    <h3>My International Journey</h3>

    <div class="timeline">
      <div>
        <strong>🇩🇪 Germany — Bachelor Studies (2020–2024)</strong><br />
        I started my academic journey at Hochschule Fresenius in Wiesbaden, studying Business Administration with a focus on Marketing, International Management and Organisational Psychology.

      <div>
        <strong>🇦🇺 Australia — Exchange Semester at UTS Sydney (2022)</strong><br />
        My first international experience abroad. Living and studying in Sydney sparked my ambition to pursue an internationally oriented career.

      <div>
        <strong>🇦🇺 Australia — BRITA Australia (Nov 2022 – Apr 2023)</strong><br />
        Worked as a Customer Insights & Data & Marketing Assistant, conducting market analysis, customer research and strategic recommendations for commercial decision-making.
      </div>

      <div>
        <strong>🇩🇪 Germany — Bachelor Graduation (Jul 2024)</strong><br />
        Completed my Bachelor's degree and decided to take the next step towards an international career.

        Returned to Sydney to pursue a Master's degree focused on Global Strategic Management and Global Supply Chain Management.

        Returning to Germany after several years of studying and working in Australia, bringing international experience and a global perspective.

      <div>
        <strong>🌍 Next Step: Bridgestone?</strong><br />
        The European Graduate Program in Marketing combines exactly the areas that excite me most: brand strategy, customer insights, international collaboration and continuous development.

    <h3>Why Bridgestone?</h3>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        For me, Bridgestone represents more than a global mobility company. It represents the ability to connect strong brands, customer needs, innovation and sustainable business growth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Few companies combine international reach, brand strength and a strong focus on mobility and innovation as successfully as Bridgestone.
      </p>

      <p>
        What excites me most is the opportunity to work at the intersection of customer understanding, marketing and business strategy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The European Graduate Program in Marketing offers exposure to Brand Management, Customer Insights, Digital Marketing, Market Analysis and international collaboration — exactly the combination that aligns with my background, interests and long-term career ambitions.
      </p>

      <p>
        After studying and working in Australia, I am looking for a role that allows me to bring an international mindset back to Germany. Bridgestone’s global footprint, focus on innovation and commitment to long-term development make the company an ideal environment for my next step.

    <h3>Why This Program Stands Out To Me</h3>

    <div class="cards">
      <div class="card">
        <div class="emoji">📈</div>
        <h4>Brand Management</h4>
        <p>
          I want to understand how strong consumer brands are built, positioned and developed over time. The Brand Management rotation offers the opportunity to connect consumer insights, communication and activation concepts in a practical business context.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <div class="emoji">🤝</div>
        <h4>Customer Insights & Data</h4>
        <p>
          For me, marketing is not only about creative ideas, but also about understanding customers and making data-driven decisions. The program’s focus on market analysis, insights and business intelligence is therefore especially attractive to me.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <div class="emoji">🌍</div>
        <h4>European Exposure</h4>
        <p>
          The European exposure is one of the strongest reasons why this program stands out to me. It connects perfectly with my own international background and offers the chance to understand how marketing strategies are adapted across markets.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="intro" style="margin-top: 35px;">
      <p>
        What makes this program especially attractive to me is that it does not focus on one single function. It combines Marketing, Brand Management, Customer Insights, Digital Marketing and international collaboration and therefore provides a broad commercial foundation. This is exactly the kind of cross-functional development I am looking for as I start my career.

    <h3>My Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      I moved across continents to challenge myself, stepped outside my comfort zone to pursue international opportunities and developed a strong passion for marketing, customer insights and brand-focused business.

    <p>
      Now I am looking for an environment where I can continue learning, take responsibility and contribute to the growth of a global brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      For me, Bridgestone is exactly that environment.
